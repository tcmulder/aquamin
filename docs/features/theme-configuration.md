# Theme Configuration

## Component Philosophy
All sites can be broken down into meaningful components, combined in various ways to create a unified whole. Just like it does for blocks, aquamin capitalizes on this concept by making it _really_ easy to work with individual components.

Each component is it's own self-contained directory where you'll handle all development for that particular piece of the site (it may help to read [aquamin's block philosophy](/features/block-configuration#block-philosophy) for more on the theory behind this).

## Creating Components

The easiest way to create a component is to run `wp aquamin component create` ([see the docs](features/wp-cli#wp-aquamin-component-create)). Then, just restart webpack, and the scaffolded component is ready for you to customize within its own directory inside `aquamin/assets/component-library/`.

?> If you'd prefer not to use WP-CLI, you can simply add your own components as individual directories within `aquamin/assets/component-library/`. You can use the files within `aquamin/includes/cli/templates/component/` as a starting point if it's helpful, replacing all the "template" placeholder code and filename prefixes with your component's name.

### File Naming and Enqueuing Conventions

Not all components are alike, so the files each requires will differ. The `wp aquamin component create` command will ask if you want the following:

|  CSS/JS&nbsp;Suffix  | Compiled&nbsp;File&nbsp;Within&nbsp;`aquamin/dist/`  | Enqueued&nbsp;By           | Purpose
|  -              | -                                          | -                     | - 
|  `theme.css`    | `global/theme.bundle.css`                  | front-end globally    | theme-wide styling
|  `theme.js`     | `global/theme.bundle.js`                   | front-end globally    | theme-wide behavior
|  `editor.css`   | `global/editor.bundle.css`                 | back-end globally     | block editor styling
|  `view.css`     | `component-library/<name>/<name>-view.css` | `hooks.php` manually  | component styling
|  `view.js`      | `component-library/<name>/<name>-view.js`  | `hooks.php` manually  | component behavior

|  PHP&nbsp;Suffix  | Where Included via PHP                                                                                    | Purpose
|  -                | -                                                                                                         | -
|  `hooks.php`      | automatically included via aquamin's `functions.php` file                                                 | wordpress&nbsp;hooks&nbsp;and&nbsp;filters
|  `view.php`       | manually via `get_template_part('dist/component-library/<name>-view')` wherever component should appear | front-end html output of the component

?> When you use the `wp aquamin component create` command, you'll conveniently find the `get_template_part()` call (including the correct path) in the  `view.php` file's header comment.

### JavaScript and CSS Pre-Processing

Aquamin uses Babel and PostCSS to process .js and .css files, so you can use modern, standards-compliant ES6 and CSS features typically without worrying about polyfills, prefixes, etc. And, though aquamin doesn't employ TypeScript or SASS features out of the box, you can use .ts or .scss file extensions to support these features if you'd prefer.


### File Name Prefixing

Note that the above shortened filenames work, but for easier debugging aquamin prefixes them like `example-component-theme.js`, `example-component-view.css`, `example-component-view.php`, etc.

### Examples

An example is the built-in `aquamin/assets/component-library/menu/` main menu component.

[text](../../assets/component-library/menu/menu-theme.css) [text](../../assets/component-library/menu/menu-theme.js) [text](../../assets/component-library/menu/menu-view.php)

```
ðŸ“‚ assets
 â”— ðŸ“‚ component-library  // directory containing all components
   â”— ðŸ“‚ menu             // the component's unique name
     â”£ ðŸ“„ menu-view.php  // HTML/PHP for the menu component
     â”£ ðŸ“„ menu-theme.css // site-wide main menu styling
     â”— ðŸ“„ menu-theme.js  // site-wide main menu behavior
```

Aquamin then includes this component via `get_template_part( 'dist/component-library/menu/menu-view' )` in the site's header.

## Built In Components

The following components come with the aquamin theme. You'll add your own alongside these in the same `aquamin/assets/component-library/` directory.

```
ðŸ“‚ assets
 â”— ðŸ“‚ component-library    // all preinstalled components are within this folder
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ 404                // 404 error message component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ blog               // blog (single, archive, sidebar, etc.)
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ footer             // site's footer component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ header             // site's header component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ menu               // site's main menu navigation in the header
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ no-content         // reusable "no posts" message component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ page               // general page torso component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ password-protected // password-protected posts component
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ search             // search-related components
   â”— ðŸ“‚ wp-overrides       // wordpress styling overrides
```

## Global Features

Aquamin includes some global features that apply site-wide across all components and blocks. Edit the code within these files to meet the requirements of your theme.

```
ðŸ“‚ assets
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ util                  // reusable js utility functions
 â”— ðŸ“‚ global                // global styling that exists site-wide
   â”£ ðŸ“„ alignment.css       // block alignment customizations
   â”£ ðŸ“„ animations.css      // reusable multi-component keyframe animations
   â”£ ðŸ“„ fonts.css           // custom font imports (see Fonts below)
   â”£ ðŸ“‚ normalize           // global styling for common html elements you'll customize
   â”£ ðŸ“„ shame.css           // styling we hope to fix later (occurs last in cascade)
   â”£ ðŸ“„ theme.css           // main entry file (coordinates global styling cascade)
   â”— ðŸ“„ variables.css       // css custom properties (first in cascade)
```

In addition, you'll find the `theme.bundle.js` and `editor.bundle.js` files, which webpack uses as an entry point for compiling global front-end styling/scripts and back-end block editor styling/scripts, respectively.

## Fonts
You should add fonts to a `aquamin/assets/global/fonts/` folder, then add the `@font-face` definitions in the `aquamin/assets/global/fonts.css` file. Webpack will take care including your font files within the `aquamin/dist/` directory, and aquamin will enqueue them.

Or, you can directly enqueue any fonts from a CDN (like Google Fonts) within the `aquamin/functions.php` file.

## Images

You can add images for a component within an "images" folder in that component's directory (e.g. `aquamin/assets/component-library/some-component/images/icon.png`), then include them via a relative path (e.g. `background-image: url("./images/icon.png")` in `aquamin/assets/component-library/some-component/some-component-theme.css`).

If you have images that multiple components need to use, create your own `aquamin/assets/images` directory for them. Then, reference them via a relative path (e.g. `background-image: url("../../images/fpo.png")` in `aquamin/assets/component-library/some-component/some-component-theme.css`).

## SVGs

Usually, webpack imports all images as a URL, including SVG images. If you would instead like to import your SVG images inline, you can name them like `*.inline.svg`, and webpack will handle inlining them for you. For example, aquamin blocks use an `icon.inline.svg` image as their block icon in this manner (feel free to modify these with your own custom icons!).

## Static Assets

You may want to include static assets in the `aquamin/dist/` directory. One example could be for a `theme.sprite.svg` sprite file containing reusable logos, social icons, etc. Add these files within the `aquamin/assets/static/` directory, and webpack will copy them into the `aquamin/dist/static/` directory for you to use.
