# Aquamin WordPress Theme

Aquamin is a minimal theme for custom WordPress development, with first-class support for your own Gutenberg blocks and custom compontents built right in.

Aquamin begins as a white page with blue links that turn purple when you click them—in other words, there's no styling whatsoever—so you can craft your own code rather than wrestling with a bunch of pre-fab stuff. It's like a solid block of marble, full of potential and free of restriction, and you're the sculptor.

But at the same time, aquamin comes with some handy, almost-always-needed features already baked in, plus a methodology that makes it a breeze to template out your own custom blocks and theme components.
