    "content": "Aquamin’s goal is to make it really easy to create blocks, remove them, or transfer them to future aquamin-themed sites. In order to accomplish this, each block is it’s own self-contained directory, with all files necessary for it to function contained within that directory. There’s no configuration you need to do outside of that directory to get the block working, and all your development occurs within that directory so you can spend less time tracking down files across the theme’s filesystem. If you want to move that block to another aquamin-compatible site in the future, you need only copy and paste it’s directory into the new site (and then tweak styling to match the new site). And if you decide to get rid of a block, simply delete it’s directory, and it’ll leave behind no extra code bloat across other files in the theme—it’s 100% gone. Easy peasy! . ",

    "doc": "Block Configuration",
    "title": "Creating Blocks",
    "content": "The easiest way to create blocks is to run wp aquamin block (see the docs). If you have parcel running, just refresh WordPress and the scaffolded block will immediately be available as a registered block, ready for you to customize within its own directory in aquamin/blocks/block-library/. Note: If you would prefer not to use WP-CLI, simply copy the appropriate block scaffold directory out of aquamin/includes/cli/templates/ and conduct a find and replace for the various “template” placeholder strings you’ll find within its files. Front-End JavaScript Option . The wp aquamin block command will ask if you want to add a script.js file to your block that will be immediately available for front-end scripting. (Under the hood, aquamin/blocks/blocks.js is simply importing all ./block-library/*/script.js files, so you can easily remove or add script.js files later.) . If you’d like to break the front-end scripts into multiple files, you can use this script.js file as an entry point and organize your additional files as desired within the block’s directory. Inner Blocks Option . The wp aquamin block command will ask if you’d like an inner block set up. This is a common pattern if your parent block requires a codependent inner block (e.g. a Slider parent block with multiple Slide inner blocks). You’ll add styles and scripts to your inner block via it’s parent’s style.css and optional script.js files, rather than within the inner block’s directory. This simplifies things by eliminating the need to jump between multiple files to develop blocks that are so tightly coupled anyway (see Anatomy of a Block for more details). Dynamic Block Option . Though aquamin prefers blocks be built with JavaScript, in some cases blocks require up-to-date data from the database, and therefore require PHP. So, wp aquamin block will ask if you need a dynamic block, and will create a markup.php file to facilitate your edits. (Note that it doesn’t currently provide automated inner block setup if you choose to go dynamic: if you need that, you’ll have to add your dynamic inner block manually.) . ",

You can run npm run clean &amp;&amp; npm run start if you would like to clear the cache immediately before starting the build server each time. Note: if you don’t do this and you delete a file Parcel was watching, builds will fail. Maybe future releases of Parcel will eliminate this requirement.

Instead, we need to destructure from the // existing wp object: const { MediaPlaceholder, InspectorControls } = wp.blockEditor; . Many examples you’ll see online just import everything, but I was unable to get Parcel to behave like Webpack and properly use the wp object without it being imported twice (and therefore throwing all manner of errors).

The overall naming format is as follows: . --&lt;color&gt;-&lt;variant 1/2/3/etc&gt;-&lt;brightness 000(darkest)-900(lightest)&gt; . So, for instance, --c-1-800 would be a light primary color, --c-1-500 would be a normal/mid primary color, and --c-1-200 would be a dark primary color. Additionally, --c-0-000 is black and --c-0-900 is white (while other --c-0-&lt;number&gt; colors are various values of gray). You’ll notice :root defines --c-raw-&lt;variant&gt;-&lt;brightness&gt; in HSL format (you could use RGB if you prefer), and then * sets the actual --c-&lt;variant&gt;-&lt;brightness&gt; color values, plus a --c-alpha value; this is very powerful, as it allows you do the following: . :root { --c-raw-0-000: 0, 0%, 0%; /* start with black hsl (or rgb) values only */ } * { --c-alpha: 1; /* default alpha is 100% */ --c-0-000: hsla(var(--c-raw-0-000), var(--c-alpha); /* default is solid black */ } .thing { --c-alpha: 0.5; /* we choose a different opacity for this element */ background-color: var(--c-0-000); /* we get a 50% transparent black color */ } .thing p { color: var(--c-0-000); /* we're back to solid black */ } . Lastly for colors, within the libs.php file, aquamin loops through all theme colors (set in the theme.json file) and outputs a --c-bg for each. This gives you access within CSS to the current background color. For instance, it let’s you do things like: .thing { border: 1px solid var(--c-bg); } . So, for .thing.has-0-000-background-color you’ll get a black border, and for .thing.has-0-900-background-color you’ll get a white border, matching their respective backgrounds. It’s often quite useful, especially for child or pseudo elements within colored background sections. ",

But, there’s a lot more variety to components than blocks, so aquamin keeps things flexible and mostly manual. The main thing to keep in mind is that aquamin automatically includes all style.css styling on the front-end, all editor.css styling in the block editor’s back-end, all script.js JavaScript on the front-end, and your HTML/PHP should go in markup.php files (you’ll need to manually include them with get_template_part() where they’re needed).
